# Barfly-E

Barfly is a concept product that aims to streamline the in-establishment ordering experience by allowing users to utilize their smart devices to place orders and by allowing establishments to utilize theirs to accept and deliver them. Users can create accounts and explore various “dummy bars and menus,” along with operations such as order selection, and order tracking, with stripe payments already in place. Bars/restaurants will use the Barfly-E application, the enterprise version of Barfly, to manage the orders from their side.
